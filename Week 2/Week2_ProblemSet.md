# Week 2 – Problem Set (PCA & t-SNE)

## Problem 1 (Easy)
Why must data be mean-centered before applying PCA?

---

## Problem 2 (Medium)
PCA preserves variance but not class separability.  
Explain with an example.

---

## Problem 3 (Hard)
t-SNE shows clean clusters, but classifiers perform poorly.  
Explain this paradox using high-dimensional geometry.
